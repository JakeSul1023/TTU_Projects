📂 Repository Overview
    
    This repo includes coursework from my Computer Science classes and two private security projects that focus on network and web security.

🔐 Security Projects

    These projects are private, but I’d be happy to discuss them further!
    
    1️⃣ Port Scanner
    A network security tool that scans for open ports on a target system.
    Useful for identifying misconfigured or exposed ports in security assessments.
    Built in Python, using socket programming and multi-threading for efficiency.
    
    2️⃣ Vulnerability Spider (spider_vuln)
    A web crawler that identifies security vulnerabilities in websites.
    Uses OWASP guidelines to detect potential risks.
    Designed for ethical security testing and research.

💡 Why This Matters

    These projects highlight my problem-solving skills, ability to work with real-world security challenges, and experience with programming in C++ and Python. I enjoy building tools, exploring cybersecurity, and continuously learning about ethical hacking and vulnerability research.
